A few things about me:  

+ I'm a husband, a dad, and a software craftman.
+ I love the object orienting programming

... I'm keen to learn pattern and architecture (clean, onion, hexagonal)
... My favorite programming langage is Java
... I really love the Spring framework and I promote the use of SpringBoot as soon as I can.
