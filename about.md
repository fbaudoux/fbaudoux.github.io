Hi ,
I'm using this space to write every interesting command, piece of code, pattern, tool ... that i will be happy to reuse later.
My memory is just to small to keep everything in :-)

If it can be usefull to someone else, that's great !

A few things about me:

I'm a husband, a dad, and a software craftman.

I love the object orienting programming and I'm keen to learn pattern and architecture (clean, onion, hexagonal)
My favorite programming langage is Java
I really love the Spring framework and I promote the use of SpringBoot as soon as I can.
